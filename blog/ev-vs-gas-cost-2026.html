    <p>The sticker price of an electric vehicle still gives many buyers pause. But sticker price is only one piece of the puzzle. When you factor in fuel, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and available incentives, the math between EVs and gas cars looks very different in 2026 than it did even two years ago.</p>

    <p>In this guide, we break down every major cost category with real 2026 numbers, then put it all together in a comprehensive five-year total cost of ownership comparison between a gas sedan, the Chevy Equinox EV, and the Tesla Model 3. Whether you are actively shopping or just curious, you will walk away with the complete financial picture.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
      <p>At 12,000 miles per year, an EV saves roughly <strong>$1,020 in fuel</strong> and <strong>$400-$600 in maintenance</strong> annually compared to a gas car. Over five years, those savings can fully offset a higher purchase price — and in many scenarios, the EV comes out ahead on total cost of ownership.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 1: FUEL COSTS ============ -->
    <h2>1. Fuel Costs: Electricity vs Gasoline</h2>

    <p>Fuel is where EVs deliver their most visible, month-over-month savings. The math is straightforward once you know four numbers: gas price per gallon, your car's MPG, electricity price per kWh, and your EV's efficiency in miles per kWh.</p>

    <h3>Gas Car Fuel Cost</h3>
    <p>As of early 2026, the national average gas price sits around <strong>$3.50 per gallon</strong>. The average new car sold in the US achieves roughly <strong>28 MPG</strong> (combined city/highway). That gives us a per-mile fuel cost of:</p>
    <p><strong>$3.50 / 28 MPG = $0.125 per mile</strong></p>

    <h3>EV "Fuel" Cost (Electricity)</h3>
    <p>The average US residential electricity rate in 2026 is approximately <strong>$0.14 per kWh</strong>. A typical modern EV — such as the Chevy Equinox EV or Tesla Model 3 — achieves about <strong>3.5 miles per kWh</strong>. That translates to:</p>
    <p><strong>$0.14 / 3.5 mi/kWh = $0.04 per mile</strong></p>

    <h3>Annual Savings</h3>
    <p>The difference is <strong>$0.085 per mile</strong> in favor of the EV. At the national average of 12,000 miles driven per year:</p>
    <p><strong>12,000 miles x $0.085 = $1,020 saved per year</strong></p>

    </table>

    <p>For drivers in states with cheap electricity and expensive gas — think Washington state ($0.10/kWh, $4.20/gal) — the savings jump even higher, north of $1,500 per year. In states with higher electricity rates like Connecticut ($0.26/kWh), the gap narrows but the EV still wins on fuel.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 2: MAINTENANCE ============ -->
    <h2>2. Maintenance: Fewer Parts, Lower Bills</h2>

    <p>This is where EVs quietly save owners a surprising amount of money. A battery electric vehicle has roughly 20 moving parts in its drivetrain compared to about 2,000 in an internal combustion engine. That dramatic simplification eliminates entire categories of maintenance.</p>

    <h3>What You Skip with an EV</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oil changes</strong> — EVs have no engine oil. Gas cars need changes every 5,000-7,500 miles ($50-$100 each).</li>
      <li><strong>Transmission fluid</strong> — EVs use a single-speed reduction gear. No multi-speed transmission means no transmission services.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing belts and spark plugs</strong> — These simply do not exist in an EV drivetrain.</li>
      <li><strong>Exhaust system</strong> — No catalytic converter, muffler, or exhaust manifold to corrode or fail.</li>
      <li><strong>Brake pads</strong> — EVs use regenerative braking, which recaptures energy and dramatically reduces wear on the physical brake pads. Many EV owners go 100,000+ miles before needing new pads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What EVs Still Need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tire rotations and replacements (EVs are heavier, so tires may wear slightly faster)</li>
      <li>Cabin air filter replacements</li>
      <li>Windshield wipers and washer fluid</li>
      <li>Brake fluid checks</li>
      <li>Coolant for the battery thermal management system</li>
    </ul>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>According to data from Consumer Reports, the average EV owner spends about <strong>50% less</strong> on maintenance over the vehicle's lifetime compared to a comparable gas car. That is a real, tangible difference that shows up in your bank account every single year.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 3: INSURANCE ============ -->
    <h2>3. Insurance: The One Area Where EVs Cost More</h2>

    <p>Insurance is the cost category where gas cars hold a clear advantage. EV insurance premiums in 2026 run approximately <strong>15-25% higher</strong> than comparable gas vehicles. There are a few reasons for this.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher repair costs:</strong> EV body panels often use aluminum, and battery pack damage can be extremely expensive to repair or replace.</li>
      <li><strong>Specialized labor:</strong> Fewer mechanics are certified to work on high-voltage EV systems, which drives up labor rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher replacement value:</strong> EVs tend to carry higher MSRPs, which directly affects comprehensive and collision premiums.</li>
      <li><strong>Parts availability:</strong> Some EV-specific parts, especially for newer models, have longer lead times.</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Insurance Metric</th>
          <th>Gas Car</th>
          <th>EV</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Average annual premium</td>
          <td>~$1,800</td>
          <td>~$2,200</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Premium difference</td>
          <td colspan="2">~$400/year more for EV</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The good news is that this gap is narrowing. As more EVs hit the road, repair networks expand, and insurers gather more actuarial data, premiums are gradually becoming more competitive. Some insurers now offer EV-specific discounts, and bundling home and auto policies can help reduce the difference. Shopping around is critical — premiums for the exact same EV can vary by $600 or more between carriers.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
      <p>If you charge at home with solar panels, some insurers offer "green vehicle" discounts. Also check whether your state offers EV insurance incentives — Colorado, for example, has a clean vehicle insurance credit program.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 4: DEPRECIATION ============ -->
    <h2>4. Depreciation: The Biggest Cost You Do Not See</h2>

    <p>Depreciation is the single largest cost of vehicle ownership, and it is one most buyers overlook because you do not write a check for it — you just lose the value silently over time.</p>

    <p>Historically, EVs depreciated faster than gas cars, primarily because of battery degradation concerns and rapid technology improvements that made older models feel outdated quickly. In the first three years:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>EVs:</strong> Average depreciation of approximately <strong>45%</strong> of MSRP</li>
      <li><strong>Gas cars:</strong> Average depreciation of approximately <strong>35%</strong> of MSRP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, this picture is changing in 2026. Several factors are stabilizing EV resale values:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Improved battery longevity:</strong> Modern EV batteries are routinely lasting 200,000+ miles with minimal degradation, alleviating buyer concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Mainstream adoption:</strong> As more buyers enter the used EV market, demand is rising and supporting resale prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Slower technology leaps:</strong> The year-over-year range improvements have moderated, meaning a 2024 model does not feel nearly as outdated as a 2019 model did compared to a 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>Tesla pricing stability:</strong> Tesla's price adjustments in 2024-2025 have created more predictable resale expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Depreciation</th>
          <th>Gas Car ($35K MSRP)</th>
          <th>EV ($45K MSRP)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3-year depreciation rate</td>
          <td>~35%</td>
          <td>~45%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Value lost (3 years)</td>
          <td>$12,250</td>
          <td>$20,250</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5-year depreciation rate</td>
          <td>~48%</td>
          <td>~55%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Value lost (5 years)</td>
          <td>$16,800</td>
          <td>$24,750</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>On raw depreciation dollars, the EV loses more — about $7,950 more over five years in this example. But keep in mind that the gap shrinks significantly for EVs with lower MSRPs (like the Chevy Equinox EV at $33,900), and the fuel and maintenance savings offset a substantial portion of the extra depreciation.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 5: PURCHASE PRICE ============ -->
    <h2>5. Purchase Price: The Gap Is Narrowing Fast</h2>

    <p>The average transaction price for a new EV in 2026 is approximately <strong>$45,000</strong>, while the average new gas car comes in around <strong>$35,000</strong>. That $10,000 gap is real, but it tells an incomplete story.</p>

    <p>The EV market has shifted dramatically toward affordability. Several compelling options now compete directly with mainstream gas sedans and SUVs on sticker price:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chevy Equinox EV:</strong> Starts at <strong>$33,900</strong> — a compact SUV with 319 miles of range</li>
      <li><strong>Tesla Model 3:</strong> Starts at <strong>$38,990</strong> — the best-selling EV in the US with 363 miles of range</li>
      <li><strong>Hyundai Ioniq 5:</strong> Starts at ~$42,000 — a mid-size crossover with ultra-fast 800V charging</li>
      <li><strong>Ford Mustang Mach-E:</strong> Starts at ~$37,495 — a sportier compact SUV option</li>
      <li><strong>Nissan Ariya:</strong> Starts at ~$39,590 — a comfortable, tech-forward crossover</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Chevy Equinox EV is particularly significant because it brings the starting price of a brand-new, long-range EV below the average new gas car price. For the first time, the "EVs are too expensive" argument does not hold for budget-conscious buyers.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 6: TAX CREDITS ============ -->
    <h2>6. Federal Tax Credits and Incentives in 2026</h2>

    <p>The federal EV tax credit landscape changed significantly in 2025 with the passage of the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</strong>. Here is where things stand in 2026:</p>

    <h3>What Expired</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>$7,500 new EV tax credit</strong> expired September 30, 2025 for most major manufacturers — including Tesla, GM, Ford, Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, BMW, Nissan, VW, and Stellantis — all of which exceeded the 200,000-vehicle sales cap.</li>
      <li>The <strong>$4,000 used EV tax credit</strong> expired entirely.</li>
      <li>The <strong>30% Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC)</strong> expired December 31, 2025.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Is Still Available</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>limited $7,500 new EV credit</strong> continues through December 31, 2026 for manufacturers that have not hit the sales cap: <strong>Honda, Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, and Volvo</strong>.</li>
      <li>The new <strong>Auto Loan Interest Deduction</strong> allows you to deduct up to <strong>$10,000 per year</strong> in auto loan interest for any US-assembled vehicle (gas or EV) purchased through 2028.</li>
      <li><strong>State-level incentives</strong> are unaffected by OBBBA and remain fully available. Many states offer $1,000-$5,000 in additional EV rebates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a detailed breakdown of every available credit and incentive, see our full guide: <a href="ev-tax-credit-2026.html">EV Tax Credits in 2026: What Is Still Available After OBBBA</a>.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Important Note</h4>
      <p>Even without the federal credit, the total cost of ownership math still favors many EVs over five years. The credit was a nice bonus, but it was never the primary financial argument for going electric — fuel and maintenance savings are.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 7: 5-YEAR TCO TABLE ============ -->
    <h2>7. Total 5-Year Cost of Ownership: Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>

    <p>Here is where everything comes together. We compare three vehicles over five years at 12,000 miles per year: a typical gas sedan (Honda Civic), the Chevy Equinox EV, and the Tesla Model 3. All figures assume home charging at $0.14/kWh, gas at $3.50/gallon, and no federal tax credit (since the credit has expired for Tesla and GM).</p>

    <p>At first glance, the gas sedan appears to win on five-year total cost. But there are several important caveats that can flip the result:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>State incentives:</strong> A $2,000-$5,000 state EV rebate (available in CA, CO, NJ, OR, and others) would bring the Equinox EV's total cost below the gas sedan.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher mileage drivers:</strong> At 15,000 miles/year, the EV fuel savings grow to $1,275/year, closing the gap by an additional $1,275 over five years.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising gas prices:</strong> If gas averages $4.00/gallon instead of $3.50, the gas car's fuel cost jumps by $1,070 over five years.</li>
      <li><strong>Home solar:</strong> If you charge with home solar panels, your effective electricity cost drops to near $0, saving an additional $2,400 over five years.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto loan interest deduction:</strong> The new OBBBA deduction for US-assembled vehicles can save $500-$2,000 over the loan term depending on your interest rate and loan size.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>For the average driver at 12,000 miles/year without state incentives, a budget gas sedan still edges out on pure five-year cost. But the Chevy Equinox EV is remarkably close — within $4,140 — and any combination of state rebates, higher gas prices, or above-average driving tips the scales in the EV's favor. For drivers doing 15,000+ miles per year, the EV is already cheaper to own.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 8: CHARGING ============ -->
    <h2>8. Charging Costs: Home vs Public</h2>

    <p>Not all electricity is priced the same. Where and how you charge your EV has a significant impact on your running costs.</p>

    <h3>Home Level 2 Charging (The Sweet Spot)</h3>
    <p>A Level 2 home charger (240V) is the most cost-effective way to charge. Installation costs $500-$1,500, and the charger itself runs $300-$700. Once installed, you are paying your residential electricity rate — roughly <strong>$0.14/kWh nationally</strong>. Many utilities offer off-peak EV charging rates as low as $0.06-$0.08/kWh if you charge overnight.</p>
    <p>At the average rate: <strong>$0.14/kWh / 3.5 mi/kWh = $0.04/mile</strong></p>

    <h3>DC Fast Charging (Road Trips)</h3>
    <p>DC fast chargers (like Tesla Superchargers, Electrify America, and ChargePoint) charge at much higher rates, typically <strong>$0.35-$0.50 per kWh</strong>. At the high end, that works out to about $0.14/mile — essentially the same as gasoline. Fast charging is best reserved for road trips, not daily use.</p>
    <p>At the average fast-charge rate: <strong>$0.40/kWh / 3.5 mi/kWh = $0.114/mile</strong></p>

    <h3>Workplace and Public Level 2 (Often Free)</h3>
    <p>An increasing number of employers, shopping centers, and municipalities offer free Level 2 charging. If your workplace has chargers, you could be driving on essentially free fuel during work hours. Even paid public Level 2 stations typically charge $0.15-$0.25/kWh — still cheaper than gas.</p>

    </table>

    <p>The key insight: if you can charge at home or at work, the fuel cost advantage of an EV is enormous. If you rely exclusively on DC fast charging, the advantage nearly disappears. For most EV owners, about 80-90% of charging happens at home overnight, making the average real-world cost much closer to $0.04/mile.</p>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 9: BREAK-EVEN ============ -->
    <h2>9. Break-Even Analysis: When Does the EV Pay for Itself?</h2>

    <p>The break-even point is when cumulative fuel and maintenance savings offset the higher upfront cost of the EV. Let us run the numbers for two common scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Scenario A: Chevy Equinox EV vs Honda Civic</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Price difference: $33,900 - $28,500 = <strong>$5,400</strong></li>
      <li>Annual operating savings (fuel + maintenance): $1,020 + $500 = <strong>$1,520</strong></li>
      <li>Annual insurance penalty: <strong>$300</strong></li>
      <li>Net annual savings: <strong>$1,220</strong></li>
      <li>Break-even: $5,400 / $1,220 = <strong>~4.4 years</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scenario B: Tesla Model 3 vs Toyota Camry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Price difference: $38,990 - $30,000 = <strong>$8,990</strong></li>
      <li>Annual operating savings (fuel + maintenance): $1,100 + $500 = <strong>$1,600</strong></li>
      <li>Annual insurance penalty: <strong>$450</strong></li>
      <li>Net annual savings: <strong>$1,150</strong></li>
      <li>Break-even: $8,990 / $1,150 = <strong>~7.8 years</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For high-mileage drivers (18,000-20,000 miles/year), both scenarios reach break-even 1.5-2 years sooner. Add a state incentive of $2,500-$5,000 and the Equinox EV breaks even in as little as <strong>2-3 years</strong>.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>The Takeaway on Break-Even</h4>
      <p>An affordable EV like the Chevy Equinox EV can pay for its price premium in under 5 years for the average driver. If you drive more than average, live in a state with EV incentives, or have access to cheap/free charging, the break-even comes significantly sooner. Most people keep a car for 6-8 years, which means the EV ends up cheaper over the ownership period.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============ SECTION 10: ENVIRONMENT ============ -->
    <h2>10. Environmental Impact: The Numbers Behind the Climate Argument</h2>

    <p>The financial case is compelling, but for many buyers the environmental impact matters too. Let us look at the data.</p>

    <p>According to lifecycle analyses from the EPA and Argonne National Laboratory, a typical EV produces <strong>50-70% less lifetime CO2 emissions</strong> than a comparable gas car, even accounting for battery manufacturing and the current US electricity grid mix.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Emission Category</th>
          <th>Gas Car</th>
          <th>EV (US Average Grid)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Manufacturing emissions</td>
          <td>~8 tons CO2</td>
          <td>~12 tons CO2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Annual driving emissions (12K mi)</td>
          <td>~4.6 tons CO2</td>
          <td>~1.5 tons CO2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Lifetime emissions (150K mi)</td>
          <td>~65 tons CO2</td>
          <td>~27 tons CO2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Lifetime reduction</strong></td>
          <td colspan="2"><strong>~38 tons CO2 saved (~58% reduction)</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Yes, manufacturing an EV battery produces more upfront emissions than building a gas engine. But that "carbon debt" is typically repaid within <strong>1.5-2 years</strong> of driving, after which the EV is cleaner every single mile. If you charge with renewable energy (home solar or a green utility plan), the driving emissions drop to near zero, pushing the lifetime reduction above 70%.</p>

    <p>The 38 tons of CO2 saved over a vehicle's lifetime is equivalent to planting roughly <strong>630 trees</strong> or taking a gas car off the road for <strong>8.3 years</strong>.</p>

    <!-- ============ CONCLUSION ============ -->
    <h2>The Verdict: Is an EV Worth It in 2026?</h2>

    <p>The answer depends on your specific situation, but the data makes it clear that the cost gap between EVs and gas cars is the smallest it has ever been — and for many drivers, EVs are already the cheaper option over a full ownership period.</p>

    <p><strong>An EV makes strong financial sense if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can charge at home (garage with 240V outlet or dedicated L2 charger)</li>
      <li>You drive 12,000+ miles per year</li>
      <li>You live in a state with EV incentives (CA, CO, NJ, OR, CT, NY, MA, and others)</li>
      <li>You plan to keep the vehicle for 5+ years</li>
      <li>Gas prices in your area are above $3.50/gallon</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>A gas car might still make more sense if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You cannot charge at home and would rely entirely on public fast charging</li>
      <li>You drive very few miles per year (under 8,000)</li>
      <li>You are buying a very budget gas car under $22,000</li>
      <li>You plan to sell or trade within 2-3 years (depreciation hits EVs harder early on)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The bottom line: in 2026, the question is no longer "Can I afford an EV?" For most American drivers, the real question has become "Can I afford to keep paying for gas?"</p>
