      <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
      <p>The federal $7,500 EV tax credit is gone for Tesla, GM, Ford, Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen, and Stellantis buyers. If you want the full credit in 2026, your options are limited to <strong>Honda, Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volvo, and Mazda</strong>. A new Auto Loan Interest Deduction of up to $10,000/year is available for any US-assembled vehicle, gas or electric, through 2028.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Happened: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</h2>

    <p>On July 4, 2025, the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong> (OBBBA) was signed into law, fundamentally restructuring the federal electric vehicle tax credit landscape. The legislation accelerated the 200,000-vehicle manufacturer sales cap that was originally part of the Inflation Reduction Act framework. Under the IRA, the $7,500 clean vehicle credit (Section 30D) was available to qualifying vehicles assembled in North America, with battery component and critical mineral sourcing requirements. The OBBBA kept those rules but reintroduced and accelerated the manufacturer sales cap.</p>

    <p>Here is what that means in plain English: once an automaker has sold 200,000 qualifying electric vehicles in the United States, the full $7,500 credit begins to phase out. The phase-out schedule under OBBBA is faster than the original schedule from the 2010 era, giving manufacturers only one quarter at 50% credit ($3,750) before the credit drops to zero. By September 30, 2025, every major high-volume EV manufacturer had exceeded the 200,000-unit threshold, meaning their buyers no longer qualify for any portion of the federal credit.</p>

    <p>For the remaining automakers that have not yet hit 200,000 qualifying sales, the credit stays intact through <strong>December 31, 2026</strong>, at which point the entire Section 30D clean vehicle credit program is scheduled to sunset. No extension has been passed or proposed as of February 2026.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturers That Lost the $7,500 Credit</h2>

    <p>The following automakers exceeded the 200,000-vehicle sales cap and their buyers can no longer claim the federal EV tax credit on new purchases:</p>

    <p>This list covers roughly 85% of all EVs sold in America. If you were planning to buy a Tesla Model 3, Chevy Equinox EV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, or Toyota bZ4X, you will not receive any federal tax credit on a 2026 purchase.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturers That Still Qualify Through December 31, 2026</h2>

    <p>A smaller group of automakers has not yet reached the 200,000-unit cap. Their qualifying vehicles still carry the full $7,500 federal tax credit, but only until the program sunsets at the end of 2026:</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Important: MSRP Cap Still Applies</h4>
      <p>To qualify for the credit, new EVs must have an MSRP under $55,000 for sedans or $80,000 for SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks. Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must also be under $150,000 for single filers, $225,000 for head of household, or $300,000 for joint filers. These thresholds were not changed by OBBBA.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Honda Prologue has emerged as one of the most popular choices for credit-eligible shoppers. It is built on GM's Ultium platform, offers an EPA-estimated 296 miles of range, and with the $7,500 credit applied, the effective starting price drops to roughly $39,900. Subaru's Solterra and the Volvo EX30 are also strong options in the sub-$50,000 range after the credit.</p>

    <p>Rivian and Lucid appeal to a different segment of the market. Both are luxury-oriented manufacturers with higher starting prices, but the $7,500 credit still reduces the out-of-pocket cost meaningfully. Rivian's R1S, in particular, has gained traction as a family-friendly electric SUV with genuine off-road capability.</p>

    <h2>NEW: Auto Loan Interest Deduction (Up to $10,000/Year)</h2>

    <p>While the OBBBA took away the clean vehicle credit for most buyers, it introduced something entirely new: the <strong>Auto Loan Interest Deduction</strong>. This provision allows taxpayers to deduct up to <strong>$10,000 per year</strong> in auto loan interest from their federal taxable income. The deduction applies to vehicles assembled in the United States, regardless of whether they are gas-powered, hybrid, or electric.</p>

    <p>This is a significant shift. Unlike the clean vehicle credit, which was a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, the auto loan interest deduction reduces your taxable income. The actual tax savings depend on your marginal tax rate. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At a <strong>22% tax bracket</strong>, deducting $5,000 in auto loan interest saves you <strong>$1,100</strong> in federal taxes.</li>
      <li>At a <strong>32% tax bracket</strong>, that same $5,000 deduction saves you <strong>$1,600</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you are paying the maximum $10,000/year in interest (common on loans for $60,000+ vehicles), the savings range from <strong>$2,200 to $3,700</strong> depending on your bracket.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <h4>Who Qualifies for the Auto Loan Interest Deduction?</h4>
      <p>The vehicle must be assembled in the United States. Both new and financed used vehicles qualify. The deduction is available through <strong>December 31, 2028</strong>. You must itemize deductions on your federal return to claim it. There is no income cap, but higher earners benefit more due to the progressive tax structure.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This deduction can be combined with the $7,500 clean vehicle credit for eligible manufacturers. If you buy a Honda Prologue with a $40,000 loan at 6% APR, you could claim the $7,500 credit plus deduct roughly $2,400 in first-year interest, yielding total first-year federal tax benefits approaching $8,000 to $8,500.</p>

    <h2>Used EV Credit (Section 25E): Up to $4,000</h2>

    <p>The used EV credit under Section 25E remains available in 2026, though with tighter conditions. If you buy a <strong>used electric vehicle priced at $25,000 or less</strong> from a licensed dealer, you can claim a credit of up to <strong>$4,000</strong> (or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less).</p>

    <p>Key requirements for the used EV credit:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The vehicle must be at least <strong>2 model years old</strong> (for 2026, that means 2024 or older).</li>
      <li>The purchase price must be <strong>$25,000 or less</strong>.</li>
      <li>Your adjusted gross income must be under <strong>$75,000</strong> (single), <strong>$112,500</strong> (head of household), or <strong>$150,000</strong> (joint).</li>
      <li>You can only claim this credit <strong>once every three years</strong>.</li>
      <li>The sale must go through a <strong>licensed dealer</strong>, not a private party.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This credit makes 2-3 year old Chevy Bolt EVs, Nissan Leafs, and base-model Tesla Model 3s particularly attractive in the used market. Many of these vehicles now fall comfortably under the $25,000 threshold, and the $4,000 credit can bring the effective price into the low $20,000 range or even below.</p>

    <h2>Commercial EV Credit (Section 45W): Also Expired</h2>

    <p>The commercial clean vehicle credit under Section 45W, which offered up to $7,500 for commercial EVs and $40,000 for commercial trucks and vans, was also terminated early by the OBBBA. This credit had been popular with businesses leasing EVs, since the lessor (leasing company) could claim the credit and pass the savings to the lessee through reduced monthly payments. That workaround is no longer available for most manufacturers.</p>

    <p>Businesses looking to electrify their fleets in 2026 should focus on state-level commercial incentives and the auto loan interest deduction, which applies to business vehicles as well.</p>

    <h2>EV Charger Tax Credit (Section 30C)</h2>

    <p>The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit under Section 30C provides up to <strong>$1,000 for home EV charger installations</strong> (30% of the cost) and up to $100,000 for commercial charging stations. This credit runs through <strong>June 30, 2026</strong>, after which it expires.</p>

    <p>There is an important geographic restriction: the property where you install the charger must be located in a <strong>census-designated low-income community or rural area</strong>. If you live in a suburban or urban area that does not meet this designation, you will not qualify for the federal charger credit. You can check your eligibility using the Department of Energy's <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/10513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alternative Fuels Station Locator</a> and census tract lookup tools.</p>

    <p>Even if you do not qualify for the federal credit, a Level 2 home charger (240V) typically costs $500 to $1,200 installed, and the convenience of overnight home charging eliminates the need for public charging stations in most daily use cases.</p>

    <h2>State-Level EV Incentives: Where the Real Savings Are</h2>

    <p>With the federal credit gone for most buyers, state-level incentives have become the primary source of EV purchase savings. Here are the most generous state programs still active in 2026:</p>

    <h3>California: CVRP ($2,000 - $7,500)</h3>
    <p>California's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) offers rebates of <strong>$2,000 for PHEVs</strong> and <strong>$4,500 for BEVs</strong>, with an additional <strong>$3,000 boost</strong> for low-income households (up to $7,500 total). Income caps apply: $135,000 for single filers, $200,000 for joint. California also offers the Clean Cars 4 All program with up to $9,500 for trading in older high-polluting vehicles in select air districts.</p>

    <h3>Colorado: $5,000 Tax Credit</h3>
    <p>Colorado offers one of the most straightforward state EV incentives: a <strong>$5,000 state income tax credit</strong> for new EV purchases. There is also an additional credit for trucks and an income-qualified boost. Colorado's credit can be combined with the federal credit for eligible manufacturers, making it one of the best states for EV buyers in 2026.</p>

    <h3>Connecticut: $2,250 - $7,500</h3>
    <p>Connecticut's CHEAPR program (Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate) provides <strong>$2,250 for standard EV rebates</strong> and up to <strong>$7,500 for income-eligible buyers</strong>. The program covers both BEVs and PHEVs, with higher rebates for lower-income applicants.</p>

    <h3>Other Notable State Programs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Jersey:</strong> Up to $4,000 rebate through the Charge Up New Jersey program, plus sales tax exemption on EVs (saves another $2,000-$4,000).</li>
      <li><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> MOR-EV program offers up to $3,500 for BEVs, with additional rebates for income-qualifying buyers.</li>
      <li><strong>Oregon:</strong> Up to $5,000 through the Oregon Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, with income-based tiers and an additional $5,000 for the Charge Ahead rebate for low/moderate income buyers.</li>
      <li><strong>New York:</strong> Drive Clean Rebate of up to $2,000 for new EVs purchased or leased.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Stack Your Savings</h4>
      <p>State incentives can be combined with the federal credit (for eligible manufacturers) and the auto loan interest deduction. A Colorado buyer purchasing a Honda Prologue could receive $7,500 federal + $5,000 state + auto loan interest deduction, totaling <strong>over $13,000 in first-year tax benefits</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What You Should Do in 2026</h2>

    <p>The EV incentive landscape is more complicated than it has ever been, but there are clear strategies to maximize your savings:</p>

    <h3>Option 1: Buy a Credit-Eligible EV Before December 31, 2026</h3>
    <p>If you want the $7,500 federal credit, your window closes at the end of this year. Focus on Honda Prologue, Subaru Solterra, Volvo EX30/EX90, Mercedes-Benz EQB, Rivian, Lucid, or Mazda CX-70 PHEV. Demand is rising on these models as word spreads about the credit expiration for other brands, so do not wait until Q4 when inventory may tighten.</p>

    <h3>Option 2: Buy a Used EV Under $25,000</h3>
    <p>The used EV market is flooded with excellent vehicles from manufacturers that lost the new credit. A 2024 Chevy Bolt EUV, 2023 Nissan Leaf Plus, or 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 can often be found under $25,000 at licensed dealers, qualifying for the $4,000 used EV credit. This is arguably the best value path into EV ownership in 2026.</p>

    <h3>Option 3: Maximize the Auto Loan Interest Deduction</h3>
    <p>If you are buying any US-assembled vehicle (gas or electric), make sure you finance the purchase rather than paying cash if you want to take advantage of the new auto loan interest deduction. The deduction is available through 2028 and has no income cap. Higher loan amounts and interest rates yield larger deductions.</p>

    <h3>Option 4: Explore Your State Incentives</h3>
    <p>Even if you buy a Tesla, Chevy, or Ford with no federal credit, your state may still offer substantial rebates. California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, and New Jersey are particularly generous. Check your state's program before assuming no incentives are available.</p>

    <h2>Timeline: Key Dates for EV Buyers in 2026</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Now through June 30, 2026:</strong> EV charger tax credit (Section 30C) available in qualifying low-income/rural census tracts.</li>
      <li><strong>Now through December 31, 2026:</strong> $7,500 new EV credit for Honda, Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volvo, and Mazda.</li>
      <li><strong>Now through December 31, 2026:</strong> Used EV credit of up to $4,000 for qualifying purchases under $25,000.</li>
      <li><strong>Now through December 31, 2028:</strong> Auto Loan Interest Deduction of up to $10,000/year for US-assembled vehicles.</li>
      <li><strong>January 1, 2027:</strong> All remaining Section 30D new EV credits expire. No federal credit for any new EV purchase unless new legislation is passed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>The OBBBA dramatically narrowed who benefits from the federal EV tax credit, but it did not eliminate every incentive. If you are flexible on which brand to buy, the $7,500 credit is still very much on the table. If you are set on a Tesla, Chevy, Ford, or other high-volume brand, focus on the used EV credit, the new auto loan interest deduction, and your state's incentive programs. The math still overwhelmingly favors going electric when you factor in lower fuel costs, reduced maintenance, and the incentives that remain available.</p>

    <p>Most importantly: if you want the federal credit, <strong>act before December 31, 2026</strong>. There is no indication that Congress will extend Section 30D, and once it sunsets, the federal EV tax credit as we know it will be gone.</p>
