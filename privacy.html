This data is governed by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

      <p>GreenSage itself does not set cookies. However, the third-party services described above (primarily Google AdSense) may place cookies on your device. These cookies fall into the following categories:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Cookie Type</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Set By</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>

      </table>

      <h3>Managing Cookies</h3>

      <p>You can control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>View what cookies are stored and delete them individually or in bulk.</li>
        <li>Block third-party cookies.</li>
        <li>Block cookies from specific sites.</li>
        <li>Block all cookies entirely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please note that blocking all cookies may affect the functionality of some features on the Site and other websites you visit.</p>

      <h3>localStorage</h3>

      <p>In addition to cookies, we use your browser's localStorage to save calculator data and user preferences. Unlike cookies, localStorage data is never sent to any server automatically. You can clear localStorage data at any time through your browser's developer tools or site settings. Clearing your browser data or localStorage will reset all saved calculator inputs and preferences.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email addresses:</strong> We retain your email address for as long as you remain subscribed to our communications. You may unsubscribe at any time, after which your email address will be removed from our mailing list within 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>localStorage data:</strong> Calculator data and preferences stored in localStorage persist on your device until you manually clear them or clear your browser data. We have no control over the retention of this data, as it resides entirely on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> Data collected by Google AdSense, Amazon, EnergySage, and Cloudflare is retained according to their respective privacy policies and data retention schedules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>

      <p>GreenSage is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Our calculators and content are designed for adult homeowners, vehicle owners, and consumers making financial and environmental decisions.</p>

      <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information (such as an email address), please contact us immediately at the address below. We will take prompt steps to delete such information from our records.</p>

      <p>If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete your personal information. Since the only personal information we may hold is your email address, you can exercise this right by unsubscribing or contacting us directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any email we send or by contacting us directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising through <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Ads Settings</a> or the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAI opt-out tool</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Local Data:</strong> You can delete all locally stored calculator data and preferences at any time by clearing your browser's localStorage for this site.</li>
      </ul>
