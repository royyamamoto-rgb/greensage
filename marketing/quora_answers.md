## Question: "Is solar worth it in 2026 without the federal tax credit?"

Yes, solar is still worth it for most homeowners in 2026, but the math has shifted.

**What changed:** The 30% residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired on December 31, 2025, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). This means you no longer get 30% of your system cost back as a federal tax credit.

**Why it's still worth it:**

1. **Solar panel costs have dropped 70% since 2010.** The average residential system now costs $2.50-$3.00 per watt installed, compared to $7+ per watt a decade ago.

2. **Electricity rates keep rising.** The national average is now $0.17/kWh and climbing 3-5% annually. Solar locks in your rate at $0.

3. **State incentives still exist.** 18+ states offer their own rebates, tax credits, or performance-based incentives. California, New York, Massachusetts, and Colorado have particularly strong programs.

4. **Solar lease/PPA still gets credits.** Through Section 48E, commercial entities can still claim solar tax credits. If you lease panels or sign a PPA, the installer claims the credit and passes savings to you.

5. **Home value increases.** Studies show solar adds approximately 4% to home resale value — on a $400K home, that's $16K.

**The new payback math:**
- Without the ITC: 6-10 year payback (depending on state and electricity rates)
- With the ITC (pre-2026): 4-7 year payback
- System lifespan: 25-30 years

So you're still looking at 15-20+ years of pure savings after payback.

The bottom line: solar is less of a no-brainer than it was with the 30% credit, but it's still one of the best home investments you can make in most states.

## Question: "Which electric cars still qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit in 2026?"

As of 2026, the federal EV tax credit situation has changed dramatically.

**What happened:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, July 2025) accelerated the 200,000-vehicle manufacturer sales cap. Any manufacturer that exceeded 200K cumulative EV sales lost eligibility.

**Manufacturers that LOST the credit (exceeded 200K cap):**
- Tesla (all models)
- General Motors (Chevy Equinox, Bolt)
- Ford (Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning)
- Toyota
- Hyundai/Kia (IONIQ 5, IONIQ 6, EV6)
- BMW
- Nissan
- Volkswagen
- Stellantis

**Manufacturers that STILL qualify (through December 31, 2026):**
- Honda (Prologue — $7,500)
- Rivian (R1S — $7,500)
- Lucid
- Mercedes-Benz (EQB — $7,500)
- Subaru (Solterra — $7,500)
- Volvo
- Mazda

**New alternative:** The Auto Loan Interest Deduction lets you deduct up to $10,000/year in auto loan interest for US-assembled vehicles (gas or electric), through 2028.
