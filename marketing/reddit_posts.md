**Title:** I built a free solar savings calculator that accounts for the 2026 tax credit changes
**Body:**
Hey r/solar — with the 30% ITC expiring and all the OBBBA changes, I noticed a lot of the calculators online are still showing outdated incentive data.

So I built a free tool that has accurate 2026 data — it knows which manufacturers lost the EV credit (Tesla, GM, Ford, etc.), which still qualify (Honda, Rivian, Subaru), and factors in state-level rebates for 18 states.

It also has a solar savings calculator and carbon footprint estimator.

No signup, no data collection, completely free: [greensage.pages.dev](https://greensage.pages.dev)

Would love feedback from people who actually know solar — did I get the payback calculations right?

**Title:** With the $7,500 EV credit gone for Tesla/GM/Ford, I made a calculator showing which EVs still qualify
**Body:**
Since the OBBBA manufacturer cap kicked in (Sep 2025), only 7 manufacturers still qualify for the federal EV credit: Honda, Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes, Subaru, Volvo, and Mazda — and only through Dec 2026.

I built a free EV switching calculator that shows accurate 2026 tax credits for 17 popular EVs, plus factors in fuel savings, maintenance, and the new Auto Loan Interest Deduction ($10K/yr).

Check it out: [greensage.pages.dev](https://greensage.pages.dev)

Curious what this community thinks about the cost math now that most credits are gone.

**Title:** The math on solar panels in 2026 without the federal tax credit
**Body:**
I keep seeing posts asking "is solar still worth it now that the 30% ITC expired?"

Short answer: for most homeowners, yes — but the payback period is longer (6-10 years vs 4-7 years with the credit).

I built a free calculator that lets you plug in your state, electricity bill, and roof size to see your specific numbers: [greensage.pages.dev](https://greensage.pages.dev)

Key things people miss:
- Solar panel costs dropped 70% in the last decade
- Solar lease/PPA still gets credits through Section 48E (commercial credit)
- 18 states have their own rebates that stack
- Solar adds ~4% to home resale value

Happy to answer questions about the math.
